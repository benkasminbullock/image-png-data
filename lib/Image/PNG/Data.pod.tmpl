=head1 NAME

[% info.colon %] - manipulate the image data part of PNGs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use [% info.colon %];

=head1 VERSION

This documents version [% info.version %] of [% info.name %]
corresponding to L<git commit [% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides various utilities for manipulating and testing
the image data part of a PNG image. This is a companion module to
L<Image::PNG::Libpng> by the same authors.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 alpha_used

Is the alpha channel in the image used or is it just completely opaque?

=head2 any2gray8

    my $wpng = any2gray8 ("any.png");

Convert any type of PNG file whatsoever into a bit-depth 8 grayscale
image without an alpha channel (PNG_COLOR_TYPE_GRAY). The return value
is a writing structure as made by L</create_write_struct>.

Currently the L</tRNS> chunk is ignored by this.

By default the alpha channel is set to either the value of the
L</bKGD> chunk if there is one, or white if not. You can set another
background using the option C<bkgd>:

    my $wpng = any2gray8 ('any.png', bkgd => {red => 255, green => 0, blue => 99});

This will of course be ignored if F<any.png> does not contain an alpha
channel. RGB to gray conversion is done using L</set_rgb_to_gray> with
the default values.

This function is not supported for versions of libpng earlier than
1.6.14.

=head2 bwpng

    my $png = bwpng (\@rows, sq => 20);

Convert boolean-style data into a black and white PNG.

    bwpng (\@rows, black => '#CFF', white => '#C00');

[% FOR option IN options.bwpng %]
[% option %]
[% END %]

=head2 rgb2gray

    my $gray_png = rgb2gray ('colorful.png');

Convert RGB to gray.

Options:

[% FOR option IN options.rgb2gray %]
[% option %]
[% END %]

=head2 rmalpha

Remove the alpha channel of the PNG.

=head2 split_alpha

Copy from IPL.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 Online PNG tools

=over

=item L<https://onlinepngtools.com/convert-png-to-grayscale>

Converts your PNG to grayscale via JavaScript. This actually resizes
the image to the size of its box, but you can save the image with the
Save as... link and you get the original size back.
